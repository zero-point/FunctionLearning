Based on your understanding of each relationship, you will predict the values of new points. Please follow the instructions closely and complete all the required steps.<br/><br/> The runtime of the experiments is approximately 10 minutes and there is a survey at the end. <br/><br/> This experiment does not collect any personally identifying or sensitive information, and you are free to withdraw at any time.<br/><br/> If you have any comments or questions, do not hesitate to contact Irina Preda (s1143039@sms.ed.ac.uk).<hr> To participate, click: <a onclick=\"startExperiment();return false;\" href =\"javascript:startExperiment();return false;\" > I agree to participate in this study. </a><br/><br/> If you do not wish to participate, please close this window.",
