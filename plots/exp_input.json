If you have any comments or questions, do not hesitate to contact Irina Preda (s1143039@ed.ac.uk).<p> In the following screens, you will try to understand some relationships using plots containing data points. <p> All of the relationships come from the same underlying system, so there may be similarities between them. <p> Try to use this information to make better predictions. <p> Based on your understanding of each relationship, you will predict the values of new points. <p> It should only take a few seconds to make each judgment, and there are approximately 6 relationships requiring approximately 40 judgments each. The experiment is expected to take about 20 minutes in all. Also, please take note of the following: <ul><li> There is no single correct pattern in any of the cases you will observe, but your judgments will be reviewed by a human, and your submission may be rejected if it is clear that you did not attempt to find any pattern. </li><li> Once you have submitted a judgment, you will not be able to change it - please do not attempt to use the back button during the experiment. </li> </ul > </div> <hr> <p> To participate, click: <a href =\"train_bar2.html\" > I agree to participate in this study. </a> </p> <p> If you do not wish to participate, please close this window. </p>",
